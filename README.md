# CoHClient
A client that allows for various manipulations of City of Heroes.

## Homecoming
This client targets homecoming. The provided offsets are for homecoming and must be updated by hand. This can
easily be done going forward with bindiff.  
  
You _WILL_ get banned for using this in game, but hopefully after you cause some chaos. :)
